# KeepMeAlive 🌱

**KeepMeAlive** is a fun plant care helper application built with React.  
The idea is simple: enter the name of your plant (in English), and the app will fetch care tips from an open Plant API.  
I also created custom pixel art graphics and animations to give the app a unique, playful style.

## ✨ Features
- Search for plants by name and fetch care instructions from an external API  
- Custom-made pixel art and animations for a gamified experience  
- React-based frontend with reusable components  
- (Work in progress) additional cosmetic features to improve the user experience  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- CSS  
- Plant API integration  

## 🚧 Status
The core functionality is working (API integration, custom visuals, search & tips).  
Some cosmetic features are unfinished, but the app already demonstrates the main idea and design.
